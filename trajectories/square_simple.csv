# Simple Square Trajectory - 5 waypoints
# 
# CSV Format Explanation:
# - Each row is: x, y, z, time
# - (x,y,z) = waypoint position in meters
# - time = duration in seconds to reach THIS waypoint from PREVIOUS waypoint
# - First waypoint's time = initial delay/takeoff time
#
# This trajectory:
#   Start at origin, wait 5s
#   Rise to 1m altitude in 10s
#   Move to (1,0,1) in 15s
#   Move to (1,1,1) in 15s  
#   Return to (0,0,0.5) in 20s
